# AceUnit Security Policy
Being a unit test frameework, AceUnit is meant to be a pure development tool.
Its code is not intended to be shipped as part of an actual production system.

Therefore, at present, I believe that coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities is not required.
If you find a security vulnerability, please treat it as a bug and disclose it via the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/christianhujer/aceunit/issues).
If you believe that in your situation this is wrong and the disclosure should happen in private, please send an email to one of the [authors](AUTHORS).
