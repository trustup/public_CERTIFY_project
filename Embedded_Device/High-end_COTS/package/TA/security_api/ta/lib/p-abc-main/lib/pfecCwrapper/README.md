# pfecCwrapper
Wrapper for pairing-friendly EC arithmetic in C, instanciated with miracl/core's BLS12-381 implementation

## Instalation and build
Build the cmake project:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Compile from generated Makefile (In build directory):
```sh
make
```

### Testing
The project supports testing of both the wrapper library and the dpabc implementation. Tests will be built by default, if you wish to disable it you need to comment the respective lines in the CMakeLists.txt files (plans for adding a configurable option in the future). 

Testing is based on the cmocka library. To be able to properly generate and run tests you need to complete the installation steps for cmocka, whichi is included in test/cmocka/INSTALL.md (if you are on Windows, you will have to update the path to the cmocka dll in CMakeLists.txt for correct execution of the tests, or manually copy the dll to the build directory).
Once everything is built correctly, you can (verbosely) run the tests with the command (inside the build directory):
```sh
ctest -V
```

## Documentation
You can genereta a documentation for the whole library by running ``doxygen'' in the docs folder

## Potential issues
If there is a linking error with Miracl/core's library, you need to substitute the correspoinding static labrary (e.g., core_win.a) for the one generated by following the compilation steps on their repository [Miracle/core](https://github.com/miracl/core/tree/master/c)
