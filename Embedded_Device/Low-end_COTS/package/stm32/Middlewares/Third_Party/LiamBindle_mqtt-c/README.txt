MQTT-C is an MQTT v3.1.1 client written in C. MQTT is a lightweight publisher-subscriber-based messaging protocol that is commonly used in IoT and networking applications where high-latency and low data-rate links are expected. The purpose of MQTT-C is to provide a portable MQTT client, written in C, for embedded systems and PC's alike. MQTT-C does this by providing a transparent Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL) which makes porting to new platforms easy. MQTT-C is completely thread-safe but can also run perfectly fine on single-threaded systems making MQTT-C well-suited for embedded systems and microcontrollers. Finally, MQTT-C is small; there are only two source files totalling less than 2000 lines.
